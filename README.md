# giffyAPIDeno 

Deno API for Giffy project: Search of Gifs.


## Usage

You need the latest version of Deno to run this API on Local and run the following command:

```bash

deno run --allow-net --allow-env --allow-read server.ts --port=8080

```

Remember to put the correct form to access the env variables. This project was deployed with Deno Deploy, therefore we need to change the way we access env variables.
